# Hello, I'm Phawd 👋

## 💻 Systems Administrator & Developer

I'm a systems administrator and developer with extensive experience in various computing environments. My systems experience has reached something of a zenith after decades in the field. Currently focused on Python and cross-platform hardware development solutions.

## 🧠 Background & Journey

My computing journey began at age 6 with a Commodore 64, later progressing to more advanced systems:

- **AT&T System 75** - A private branch exchange (PBX) telecommunications system from the 1980s, representing early enterprise telephony infrastructure with its own command structure and programming capabilities
- **AT&T UNIX Systems** - Worked with various AT&T UNIX versions, including UNIX System V, one of the foundational commercial UNIX implementations that influenced many later operating systems
- **Solaris** - Sun Microsystems' UNIX-based operating system known for its reliability and scalability in enterprise environments
- **SPARC Architecture** - Gained experience with Sun's RISC-based SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) hardware platform that powered many Solaris systems

This diverse experience across multiple generations of technology has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of computing systems evolution, from legacy to modern architectures.
